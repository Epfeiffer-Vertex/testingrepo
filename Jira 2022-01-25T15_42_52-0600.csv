1. Go to the URL. 2. Navigate using TAB key with the screen reader until reaching the link present under ""We have always been and always will be inventing for the single greatest purpose: Life"". 3. Press TAB key again and notice the same link is being announced by the screen reader.
h2. How to resolve the issue
h3. Recommendation

1. Group all the elements within the same <a> tag. 2. (If needed) try using <span> tags instead of <div> or <p> tags to avoid the screen reader announcing the same link several times. 3. (Only if there is an image serving also as link) Mark the <img> element with alt-text="""". Refer to: https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/H2

We need to standardize our Brightcove implementation on the Inpsyde Brightcove plugin.

Per our previous discussions it doesn't sound like there are many videos on the corporate site that use Brightcove currently (possibly outside some of the corporate country sites).

Next steps:
* Audit corporate sites for Brightcove videos
* Add Inpsyde Brightcove Plugin to Corporate repos (merck/merck2)
* Update Corporateberg Video block
* Adjust styling to align with Corporate Design System (if necessary)
* Vivid360 - Use Inpsyde Brightcove plugin instead of developing Vivid360 Brightcove module (see [this ticket|https://issues.merck.com/browse/GBLDEV-275]).

,jackje,,,,,,,"Hey Vertex,

I'm sure this is on your radar but dropping in tasks to ensure we plan for the 5.8 release to production on July 20.

https://lobby.vip.wordpress.com/2021/06/15/wordpress-5-8-beta-available-for-testing/

As you know, here's what we've done for major releases in the past. 
 * Request 5.8 update to lower, non-production environment(s) prior to release. (Maybe aim for the end of June?) 
 * After a data sync, compare visual appearance of updated environment against production. 
 * Notify market/site stakeholders of update and give them a deadline to report any issues. Thinking Merckvaccines & corporate communications will definitely want to review. 
 * Confirm that routine tasks can be completed in dashboard (create page, publish, test all blocks, menus, etc.) 
 * Cross browser testing. Per the release notes, visual changes shouldn't happen on IE 11, but we should check for the sites that support that browser. 
 * Post update to production - QA sites to ensure there are no issues. 

Of course, if we encounter any issues on lower environments, we can ask VIP told off on the release for some sites while we bug fix. Hopefully we don't need to hold up that process. 

Thanks!

,jackje,,,,,,,"We need to ensure that the OneTrust scripts load before any Tealium/GTM container loads.

We may need to coordinate with Inpsyde on the Data Analytics plugin and where that plugin loads the tracking containers.

Email summary from previous conversations:

The way that GTM and Tealium do that is via JavaScript rather than using the WP enqueuing system. See https://github.com/wpcomvip/merck/blob/master/themes/isentress2/template-parts/tracking.php#L23, which essentially tells the browser, ""Find the first script in the DOM and add us before that."" It's actually incredibly un-performant because the browser then has to literally stop everything else it's doing and parse that JS before continuing to load the page, but the tracking/analytics world doesn't seem to care.
 
That being said, the GTM and Tealium scripts don't actually become ""first"" until the original snippet I linked to is parsed by the browser. That means any scripts that are positioned higher in the source code will execute first. If you look at the source code on https://www.isentress.com/, you'll see that the Tealium loading snippet is actually second-to-last and, if you look at the waterfall in the DevTools Network tab, it loads after OT and the site scripts.
 
Now, for sites that add the GTM/Tealium loading snippet in the <head> element, that might load before OT depending on where it's located in the header template in relation to the ""wp_head()"" function. The ""wp_head()"" function is where all of the enqueued stylesheets and scripts will output. So if the GTM/Tealium loading snippet is above the ""wp_head()"" function in the template then you'll never get OT to load first unless you use a similar loading snippet and place it above the GTM/Tealium one.
 
Also, I think CSS always takes precedence ahead of JS in the ""wp_head()"" output. Even if you escalate OT's order to first for scripts, the stylesheets will always output and load first.

,jackje,,,,,,,"Hey Jeff,

We need to adjust the deeplink functionality in the m-connect pilot plugin to not force pre-reg users to complete their registration (they should be able to view a deeplink first).

Details from our email discussion:

So I believe we would just use the endpoints that Jan provides to validate an imtoken and then we would update the logic in https://github.com/wpcomvip/merck2/blob/develop/plugins/mconnect-janrain-authentication/processor.php#L195,L223 to handle the validation ourselves rather than relying on the DIH widget.
 
I think this functionality is handled by our pilot plugin so no need to interact with their theme. Rather than sending to the login page, we would detect imtoken URL query var, validate against the endpoint, and then show user page or redirect to login depending on result. This should circumvent the issues with the DIH widget's flow and should also prevent Janrain Local Storage session from being created so that if the user goes anywhere else then they'll need to log in.

Thank you very much Santosh Kumar,
 
The current version of the email service is able to send general form. I believe this was conveyed earlier.
 
Yes, that was clear. But for the ""General Form"" use case, I see there're some issues with the current implementation of the service. I'll list them below.
 
 
We are in the process of enhancing the email service to pick up the template provide as HTTP URL with .vm file extenstion. We are currently in the testing phase of this enhancement.
 
The email template mentioned is the Apache foundation velocity templates. Attached a sample .vm template file for your reference. This is chosen because it's widely used email templates. You can refer the documentation form Apache from here.
 
As I said, I had already guessed it was Apache Velocity but wanted to point out that it was not evident in the documentation. The .vm file extension is used for many file formats, and let me say that, outside the Java community, Velocity is not that commonly used/known.
 
Anyway, I see several issues:
 
1. We can't execute Java on VIP, and we don't have Java in our local development setup, so compiling Apache Velocity templates (for example, for tests) will be very cumbersome. There's no reliable implementation of that engine for PHP, which means that we can't test our templates. If you would have chosen a template engine like mustache, the solution had been language-agnostic, something I think is valuable for a service designed for the only purpose of cross-system integration.
 
2. The service only supports the email body to be built via templates, but you say that providing a template via URL is under development. So there's no ""production-ready"" way to consume the service at the moment.
 
3. Sending emails with arbitrary content will be impossible. Each and every email will need a template. That is not flexible enough for the WordPress integration. In WordPress, editors will create forms with arbitrary inputs, so we have no idea how the content of the email sent from those forms will look like. And that means we can't create a template upfront for those emails.
I think it would be much better if the service took a ""body"" request parameter accepting the already compiled email body. If that will not be possible, I'm afraid that we are going to use a single template for all emails, literally only containing:
${emailBody}
and then we will send the email body in the emailBody request parameter. Hopefully, the service will accept HTML content in the additional request parameters. But to be honest, creating a template file containing just that single word and passing its URL as a request parameter to service looks very overkill to me, but that's our only option in the lack of more flexible alternatives.
 
 
 The following statement is already added in the documentation
 
You are correct. Sorry, I missed that paragraph.
 
 
We need more details about the 'Global connector' you have mentioned. 
 
The ""Global API Connector"" was mentioned in the first message of this email thread (sent by Stephen).
But I think you don't have to worry too much about it: it's about how we are going to structure the integration on the WordPress side. From your perspective, you'll see incoming requests from WordPress.
 
 
The RMI service endpoint and documentation will be provided by tomorrow.
